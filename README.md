# templated_matrix_class
This repository has the basic version of a templated matrix class in C++. This class is also compatible for  complex numbers. For more information on this repository, visit the README file.

In the repository "templated_matrix_class", there is header file named "matrix.h" which can be included in C++ programs in order to perform basic matrix operations such as matrix-addition, matrix-subtraction, matrix-multiplication, scalar-matrix multiplication, scalar-matrix divison etc.
This matrix class is a templated matrix class making use of dynamic memory storage on a heap in C++. One can make use of numerous datatypes such as 32-bit float, 32-bit int, 64-bit double, 64-bit long int, 128-bit long double (in x86_64 architecture machine) to perform various matrix operations.
The elements in the matrix class are also compatible for complex numbers datatype (defined in "complex.h").
